# 🐠 FINDING NEMO Password Manager

> _"Because we, like Dory, tend to forget things... especially passwords!"_

Welcome to **Finding Nemo**, a secure and local password manager designed to help you "find" those elusive passwords when your memory fails you.

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before running the system, ensure you have **Python** installed on your computer.

## 🚀 How to Run

Follow these simple steps to launch your password manager:

1.  **Prepare the File:**
    Move the `Namo.py` file into the **`CoralReefs`** folder.

2.  **Open Command Prompt:**
    Inside the `CoralReefs` folder, click on the address bar at the top of the File Explorer, type `cmd`, and press **Enter**.

3.  **Launch the App:**
    In the black command window that appears, type the following command and press **Enter**:

    ```bash
    py Namo.py
    ```

    **OR** simply double-click **`Namo.exe`** inside the `CoralReefs` folder!

## ✨ Usage

Once the application launches:

- **Unlock** the vault with your master password.
- **Add** new accounts with usernames and passwords.
- **Encrypt** your data securely.
- **Retrieve** your passwords whenever you need them!

## 📸 Facial Recognition Setup

To use the secure Face ID feature:

1.  **Register your face:**
    Run the registration script by double-clicking `register_face.py` (or click `WhoismyMaster.bat `or running `py register_face.py` in cmd).
    _Look at the camera until the process completes._
    \_I suggest that you delete/ the `Whoismymaster.bat` and `register_face.py` after setup to keep other people from changing the master\_
2.  **Launch Namo:**
    Open `Namo.py` or `STARTNAMO.bat`. It will now attempt to verify your face at startup!
    _(Note: If you use the .exe, you may need to rebuild it to include these new features.)_

- **Marlin's Secret is** _Nemoishere_
  if you wish to change the Master Password you can right click `Namo.py` then Open with Notepad then `Ctrl + F` and find the master password to change it

  _Just keep swimming, and never lose a password again!_ 🌊
